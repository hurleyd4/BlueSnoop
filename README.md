# BlueSnoop 

BlueSnoop is an andriod application. It can be downloaded onto an Andriod device with bluetooth functionality.

* Ability to see which device(s) are paired with user device. 

* Auto-upload to cloud based server.  

* WhiteList, to ensure data privacy. 

* Timeline of user's device connections.

## Installation

In order to install the app, the user firstly needs to turn on their developer mode on their device. This can be done via the device settings. Once that have been done, we recommend download and opening the app code into Andriod studio. From there, using a USBC cable the app can be install onto the device, using the IDE's software.
